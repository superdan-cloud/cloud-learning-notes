# Cloud Learning Notes – Azure & Security

This repository contains my personal notes, labs, and study logs as I work toward Azure-focused cloud and security roles.

## Learning Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Microsoft Azure (starting with AZ-900).
- Transition into an Azure Cloud / Cloud Security–focused role.
- Develop hands-on skills with:
  - Azure Portal
  - GitHub
  - Visual Studio Code
  - diagrams.net (architecture diagrams)

## Current Focus

**Week 1 – Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**  
- Cloud concepts (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, CapEx vs OpEx, shared responsibility)
- Core Azure architecture (regions, availability zones, region pairs)
- Core services overview (compute, networking, storage)
- Setting up:
  - Azure Free Account
  - GitHub
  - VS Code
  - First Resource Group + Storage Account

> This repo is intentionally simple: it’s meant to show my learning process and how I organize knowledge over time.
